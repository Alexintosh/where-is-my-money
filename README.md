# where-is-my-money
EdCon 2019 Hackathon
Team: Mates

##  Problem
Funds, which are associated to one particular address, but are not in their respective ERC20 smart contract, are easly forgotten about.
So far, there is no easy tracking possibility.

##  WIMM
### What is WIMM not?
It's not another block exporer or transaction tracker. It's not doing blockchain analytics.
It is not a wallet and a user cannot exchange tokens. 

### WIMM in short:
**Where is my money? - Track your ERC20 token funds accross smart contracts on the Ethereum Mainnet.**

### WIMM use cases
**For liquid tokens** (*immediately spendable*)
- ERC20 contracts (classic use case)
- Decentralized exchanges (deposited)
- Funding market maker (e.g. uniswap)

**For illiquid/locked tokens**
- Token locking for community tokens (e.g. GNO to obtain OWL)
- Bounty networks
- Auction processes (ENS / DutchX)
- Escrow services
- DEFI (decentralized lending, decentralized debt positions)
- Pre-scheduled / committed funds
- State channels
- Vested employee token plans
- DAO experiments (locking tokens for voting powers)
- Funding Prediction Market marketmaker 

###  WIMM features
- For ERC20 tokens
- View by various address (EOA, smart contract address, ENS name) (for any user)
- Add new snippets (Dapps) (for technical user)
- Upvote / downvote snippets (Dapps)
- Claim liquid tokens (e.g. releases of token locks etc.)
- View pages of illiquid tokens

## Value proposition
- Permissionless
- Community to be active which derives scalable (not dependent on centralized entity adding/whitelisting/accepting individual smart contracts)
- Release storage by users claiming amounts
- Missing piece of infrastructure
- WIMM to improve usability and help adoption
- Paying attention to smaller amounts!
- Problem magnifies with upgradable smart contracts and updates to graphical user interfaces (tracks balances of "outdated" contracts)

##  Add features
- Notifications when amounts become newly claimable (change from illiquid to liquid)
- Adding further token standards
- Feature to approve tokens to smart contract addresses and remove approval (important due to possible malicious smart contract upgrades)
- Adding Etherscan links to contracts
- Evolve into a smart contract standard via ERC
- Integratation into wallets
